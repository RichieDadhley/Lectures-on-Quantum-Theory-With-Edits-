# Frederic Schuller's Lectures on Quantum Theory

This is the LaTeX source code for my lecture notes to accompany Frederic Schuller's course on Quantum Theory, taught in the summer of 2015 at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg as part of the Elite Graduate Programme.

The entire course is hosted on YouTube at the following address:

These lecture notes are not endorsed by Dr. Schuller or the University.

While I have tried to correct typos and errors made during the lectures (some helpfully pointed out by YouTube commenters), I have also taken the liberty to add and/or modify some of the material at various points in the notes. Any errors that may result from this are, of course, mine.

If you have any comments regarding these notes, feel free to get in touch. Visit my blog for the most up to date version of these notes

My gratitude goes to Dr. Schuller for lecturing this course and for making it available on YouTube.
