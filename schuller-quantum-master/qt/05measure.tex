Let $M$ be a non-empty set. A collection $\Sigma\subseteq\mathscr{P}(M)
$ of subsets of $M$ is called a \emph{$\sigma$-algebra}\index{$\sigma$-algebra} for $M$ if the following conditions are satisfied
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item $M\in \Sigma$
\item if $A\in \Sigma$, then $M\setminus A \in \Sigma$
\item for any sequence $\{A_n\}_{n\in \N}$ in $\Sigma$ we have $\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n\in\Sigma$.
\een
\ed

\br
If we relax the third condition so that it applies only to finite (rather than countable) unions, we obtain the notion of an \emph{algebra}, often called an \emph{algebra of sets} in order to distinguish it from the notion of algebra as a vector space equipped with a bilinear product, with which it has nothing to do. 
\er

\br
Note that by condition (ii) and De Morgan's laws, condition (iii) can be equivalently stated in terms of intersections rather than unions. Recall that De Morgan's laws ``interchange'' unions with intersections and vice-versa under the complement operation. That is, if $M$ is a set and $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ is a collection of sets, then
\bse
M \setminus \biggl(\bigcup_{\,i\in I}A_i\biggr) = \bigcap_{i\in I}(M\setminus A_i),\qquad \quad
M \setminus \biggl(\bigcap_{\,i\in I}A_i\biggr) = \bigcup_{i\in I}(M\setminus A_i).
\ese
\er

A $\sigma$-algebra is closed under countably infinite unions (by definition) but also under countably infinite intersections and finite unions and intersections.
\bp
Let $M$ be a set and let $\Sigma$ be a $\s$-algebra on $M$. Let $\{ A_n \}_{n\in \N}$ be a sequence in $\Sigma$. Then, for all $k\in \N$, we have
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\bigcup_{n=0}^k{A_n} \in \Sigma$
\item $\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty}{A_n} \in \Sigma \ $ and $\ \bigcap_{n=0}^k{A_n} \in \Sigma$.

\item Let the sequence $\{B_n\}_{n\in \N}$ be defined as follows:
\bse
B_n = \begin{cases} A_n \quad &\t{if }\ 0 \leq n \leq k\\
 \varnothing \quad &\t{if }\ n > k. \end{cases} 
\ese
Then, $\{B_n\}_{n\in \N}$ is a sequence in $\Sigma$, so $ \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{B_n} \in \Sigma$. Hence, we have:
\bse
\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{B_n} = \biggl(\bigcup_{\,n=0}^{k}{B_n}\biggr)\cup \biggl(\bigcup_{\,n=k+1}^{\infty}{\negmedspace B_n}\biggr)=\bigcup_{n=0}^k{A_n}
\ese
and thus $\bigcup_{n=0}^k{A_n} \in \Sigma$.

\item As $\{A_n\}_{n\in \N}$ is a sequence in $\Sigma$, so is $\{M\setminus A_n\}_{n\in \N}$ and hence $\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}{(M\setminus A_n)} \in \Sigma$. Thus, we also have
\bse
M \setminus \biggl( \bigcup_{\,n=0}^{\infty}{(M\setminus A_n)} \biggr) \in \Sigma
\ese
and since $M\setminus(M\setminus A_n)=A_n$, by De Morgan's laws, $\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty}{A_n} \in \Sigma$. That this holds for finite intersections is shown by defining $\{B_n\}_{n\in \N}$ as above. \qedhere

\bd
A \emph{measurable space} is a pair $(M,\Sigma)$ where $M$ is a set and $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $M$. The elements of $\Sigma$ are called \emph{measurable subsets} of $M$.
\ed

Our goal is to assign volumes (i.e.\ measures) to subsets of a given set. Of course, we would also like this assignment to satisfy some sensible conditions. However, it turns out that one cannot sensibly assign volumes to any arbitrary collection of subsets of a given set\footnoteurl{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-measurable_set}{}. It is necessary that the collection of subsets be a $\sigma$-algebra. In addition, just like in topology openness and closeness are not properties of subsets but properties of subsets with respect to a choice of topology, so does measurability of subsets only make sense with respect to a choice of $\sigma$-algebra. In particular, a given subset could be measurable with respect to some $\sigma$-algebra and not measurable with respect to some other $\sigma$-algebra.

\be
The pair $(M,\mathscr{P}(M))$ is a measurable space for any set $M$. Of course, just like the discrete topology is not a very useful topology, the power set $\mathscr{P}(M)$ is not a very useful $\sigma$-algebra on $M$, unless $M$ is countable.

Both sides of the equation in part (ii) of the definition of measure might take the value $\infty$. There are two possible reasons why $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_n)$ might be infinite. It could be that $\mu(A_n) = \infty$ for some $n\in \N$ or, alternatively, it could be that $\mu(A_n) < \infty$ for all $n \in \N$ but the sequence of partial sums $\{ \sum_{i=0}^{n}\mu(A_i)\}_{n\in\N}$, which is an increasing sequence since $\mu$ is non-negative by definition, is not bounded above.

n & \text{ if $A$ is a finite set with $n$ elements}\\
\infty & \text{ if $A$ is not a finite set}

Then, by definition, $\mu(\vn) =0$. Moreover, if $\{A_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is a pairwise disjoint sequence in $\Sigma$ such that all but a finite number of $A_n$'s are empty and each $A_n$ has a finite number of elements, we have:
\bse
\mu \biggl( \bigcup_{\,n=0}^{\infty}A_n\biggr) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_n)
\ese
by counting elements. Otherwise, that is, if an infinite number of $A_n$'s are non-empty or if at least one $A_n$ is infinite, then
\bse
\mu \biggl( \bigcup_{\,n=0}^{\infty}A_n\biggr) = \infty = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_n)

and thus, the triple $(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N),\mu)$ is a measure space. The measure $\mu$ on $(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N))$ is called \emph{counting measure} and it is the usual measure on countable measurable spaces.

\subsection[\texorpdfstring{Borel $\sigma$-algebras}{Borel \textsigma-algebras}]{Borel $\sigma$-algebras}

We have already remarked the parallel between topologies and $\sigma$-algebras. A further similarity stems from the fact that, just like for topologies, interesting $\sigma$-algebras are hardly ever given explicitly, except in some simple cases. In general, they are defined implicitly by some membership condition.

\item Let $A \in \Sigma$. Then, $A \in \Sigma_i$ for all $i \in I$

Let $M$ be a set and let $\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(M)$ be a collection of subsets of $M$. The $\sigma$-algebra \emph{generated} by $\mathcal{E}$, denoted $\sigma(\mathcal{E})$, is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $M$ containing all the sets in $\mathcal{E}$. That is,

\ed

\bt
Let $(M,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space. Then, $\Sigma=\sigma(\mathcal{E})$ for some $\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(M)$.
\et

%That is, every $\sigma$-algebra on $M$ is generated by some collection of subsets of $M$. 
This generating construction immediately allows us to link the notions of topology and $\sigma$-algebra on a set $M$ via the following definition.

\bd
Let $(M,\mathcal{O})$ be a topological space. The \emph{Borel $\sigma$-algebra}\index{Borel $\sigma$-algebra} on $(M,\mathcal{O})$ is $\sigma(\mathcal{O})$. 
\ed

Recall that a topology on $M$ is a collection $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(M)$ of subsets of $M$ which contains $\varnothing$ and $M$ and is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary (even uncountable) unions. The elements of the topology are called \emph{open sets}.
Of course, while there many choices of $\sigma$-algebra on $M$, if we already have a topology $\mathcal{O}$ on $M$, then the associated Borel $\sigma$-algebra is very convenient choice of $\sigma$-algebra since, as we will soon see, it induces a measurable structure which is ``compatible'' with the already given topological structure.

This is, in fact, the usual philosophy in mathematics: we always let the stronger structures induce the weaker ones, unless otherwise specified. For instance, once we have chosen an inner product on a space, we take the norm to be the induced norm, which induces a metric, which in turn induces a topology on that space, from which we now know how to obtain a canonical $\sigma$-algebra. 

We remark that, while the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on a topological space is generated by the open sets, in general, it contains much more that just the open sets.

\be
Recall that the standard topology on $\R$, denoted $\mathcal{O}_{\R}$, is defined by
\bse
A\in \mathcal{O}_{\R} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \forall \, a\in A : \exists \, \varepsilon > 0 : \forall \, r \in \R : \ |r-a|<\varepsilon \, \Rightarrow\,  r\in A.
\ese
In fact, the elements of $\mathcal{O}_{\R}$ are at most countable unions of open intervals in $\R$. Consider now the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $(\R,\mathcal{O}_{\R})$. Let $a<b$. Then, for any $n\in \N$, the interval $(a-\tfrac{1}{n},b)$ is open. Hence, $\{(a-\tfrac{1}{n},b)\}_{n\in \N}$ is a sequence in $\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$. Since $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable intersections, we have
\bse
\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty}(a-\tfrac{1}{n},b) = [a,b) \in \sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R}).
\ese
Hence, $\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$ contains, in addition to all open intervals, also all half-open intervals. It is not difficult to show that it contains all closed intervals as well. In particular, since singletons are closed, $\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$ also contains all countable subsets of $\R$. In fact, it is non-trivial\footnoteurl{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set#Non-Borel_sets}{} to produce a subset of $\R$ which is not contained in $\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$.

such that for all $a_i,b_i\in\R$ with $1\leq i\leq d$ and $a_i<b_i$, we have

The measure $\lambda^d$ is called the \emph{Lebesgue measure} on $\R^d$.
\ed

The superscript $d$ in $\lambda^d$ may be suppressed if there is no risk of confusion. Note that the Lebesgue measure on $\R$, $\R^2$ and $\R^3$ coincides with the standard notions of length, area and volume, with the further insight that these are only defined for the elements of the respective Borel $\sigma$-algebras.

\bp
The Lebesgue measure on $\R$ is finite.

Consider the sequence $\{[a_n,a_n+1)\}_{n\in\N}$ where
\bse
a_n = %\tfrac{1}{4} (-1)^n (2 n-1 + (-1)^n )
\begin{cases}
-\tfrac{1}{2}n & \text{ if $n$ is even}\\
\tfrac{1}{2}(n+1) & \text{ if $n$ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\ese
That is, $\{a_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is the sequence $(0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,\ldots)$.\\


\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \i in {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} {
\draw (\i,0.1)--(\i,-0.1) node[below=2pt] {$\i$};
};
\foreach \i in {-3,-1,1} {
 \foreach \j in {0,1} {
  \draw (\i+\j,1-0.4*\j)--(\i+\j+1,1-0.4*\j) ;
  \draw[fill] (\i+\j,1-0.4*\j) circle [radius=0.08] ;
  \draw[fill=white] (\i+\j+1,1-0.4*\j) circle [radius=0.08] ;
};};
\draw[->]  (-3.6,0)--(3.6,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Clearly, we have $\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}[a_n,a_n+1) = \R$. Since, for all $n\in \N$, $[a_n,a_n+1)\in\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$ and $\lambda\bigl([a_n,a_n+1)\bigr) = 1<\infty$, the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ is finite.
\eq

This can easily be generalised to show that $\lambda^d$ is finite for all $d\geq 1$.


\subsection{Measurable maps}

As we have remarked earlier, once we introduce a new structure, we should immediately think about the associated structure-preserving maps. In the case of measurable spaces, a measurable map is one that preserves the ``measurability'' structure.

\bd
Let $(M,\Sigma_M)$ and $(N,\Sigma_N)$ be measurable spaces. A map $f\cl M\to N$ is said to be \emph{measurable}\index{measurable map} if
\bse
\forall \, A\in \Sigma_N : \ \preim_f(A)\in \Sigma_M.
\ese
\ed

Note that this is exactly the definition of continuous map between topological spaces, with ``continuous'' replaced by ``measurable'' and topologies replaced by $\sigma$-algebras. 

\bl
Let $(M,\Sigma_M)$ and $(N,\Sigma_N)$ be measurable spaces. A map $f\cl M\to N$ is measurable if, and only if,
\bse
\forall \, A\in \mathcal{E} : \ \preim_f(A)\in \Sigma_M,
\ese
where $\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathscr{P}(N)$ is a generating set of $\Sigma_N$.
\el

\bc
\label{cor:ContinuousMeasurable}
Let $(M,\mathcal{O}_M)$ and $(N,\mathcal{O}_N)$ be topological spaces. Any continuous map $M\to N$ is measurable with respect to the Borel $\sigma$-algebras on $M$ and $N$.
\ec

Recall that a map $\R\to\R$ is monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing.

\bc
Any monotonic map $\R\to\R$ is measurable with respect to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra (with respect to $\mathcal{O}_{\R}$).
\ec

\bp
Let $(M,\Sigma_M)$, $(N,\Sigma_N)$ and $(P,\Sigma_P)$ be measurable spaces. If $f\cl M\to N$ and $g\cl N\to P$ are both measurable, the so is their composition $g \circ f\cl M\to P$.
\ep

\bq
Let $A\in \Sigma_P$. As $g$ is measurable, we have $\preim_g(A)\in\Sigma_N$. Then, since $f$ is measurable, it follows that
\bse
\preim_f(\preim_g(A)) = \preim_{g\circ f}(A) \in \Sigma_M.
\ese
Hence, $g\circ f$ is measurable.
\eq

\bp
\label{prp:MeasurablePointwiseLimit}
Let $(M,\Sigma_M)$ and $(N,\Sigma_N)$ be measurable spaces and let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$ be a sequence of measurable maps from $M$ to $N$ whose pointwise limit is $f$. Then, $f$ is measurable.
\ep
Recall that $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$ converges pointwise to $f\cl M\to N$ if
\bse
\forall \, m\in M : \ \lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(m)=f(m).
\ese
This is in contrast with continuity, as pointwise convergence of a sequence of continuous maps is not a sufficient condition for the continuity of the pointwise limit. In the case of real or complex-valued maps, a sufficient condition is convergence with respect to the supremum norm. 

\subsection{Push-forward of a measure}

If we have a structure-preserving map $f$ between two instances $A$ and $B$ of some structure, and an object on $A$ (which depends in some way on the structure), we can often use $f$ to induce a similar object on $B$. This is generically called the push-forward of that object along the map $f$.

\bp
Let $(M,\Sigma_M,\mu)$ be a measure space, let $(N,\Sigma_N)$ be a measurable space and let $f\cl M\to N$ be a measurable map. Then, the map
\bi{rrCl}
f_*\mu\cl & \Sigma_N & \to & [0,\infty]\\
& A & \mapsto & \mu(\preim_f(A))
\ei
is a measure on $(N,\Sigma_N)$ called the \emph{push-forward}\index{push-forward of a measure} of $\mu$ along $f$.
\ep

That $f_*\mu$ is a measure follows easily from the fact that $\mu$ is a measure and basic properties of pre-images of maps, namely
\bi{rCl}
\preim_f(A\setminus B) & = & \preim_f(A)\setminus \preim_f(B)\\ \preim_f\biggl(\bigcup_{\,i\in I}A_i\biggr) & = & \bigcup_{i\in I}\preim_f(A_i).
