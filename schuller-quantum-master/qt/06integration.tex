We will now focus on measurable functions $M\to \overline{\R}$ and define their integral on a subset of $M$ with respect to some measure on $M$, which is called the Lebesgue integral. Note that, even if $M\subseteq\R^d$, the Lebesgue integral of a function need not be with respect to the Lebesgue measure. 

The key application of this material is the definition of the Banach spaces of (classes of) Lebesgue integrable functions $L^p$. The case $p=2$ is especially important since $L^2$ is, in fact, a Hilbert space. It appears a lot in quantum mechanics where it is loosely referred to as the space of square-integrable functions.

Equivalently, $s\cl M \to \R$ is simple if there exist $r_1,\ldots,r_n\in\R$ and $A_1,\ldots,A_n\in\mathscr{P}(M)$, for some $n\in \N$, such that
\bse
s = \sum_{i=1}^nr_i\chi_{A_i}.

So $s$ is simple if it is a linear combination of characteristic functions.

\subsection{Integration of non-negative measurable simple functions}

We begin with the definition of the integral of a non-negative, measurable, simple function.

\bd
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $s\cl M \to \R$ be a nowhere negative, measurable, simple function whose standard form is $s=\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \chi_{A_i}$. Then, we define
\bse
\int_M \! s \, \d \mu := \sum_{i=1}^nr_i\mu(A_i).
\ese
\ed

Note that the non-negativity condition is essential since $\mu$ takes values in $[0,\infty]$, hence we could have $\mu(A_i)=\infty$ for more that one $A_i$, and if the corresponding coefficients $r_i$ have opposite signs, then we would have $\int_Ms\,\d\mu=\infty-\infty$, which is not defined. For the same reason, we are considering $s\cl M\to [0,\infty)$ rather than $s\cl M\to [0,\infty]$.
\be
Consider the measure space $(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N),\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the counting measure, let $f\cl \N \to \R$ be non-negative and suppose that there exists $N\in\N$ such that $f(n)=0$ for all $n>N$. Then, we can write $f$ as
\bse
f=\sum_{n=0}^Nf(n)\chi_{\{n\}}.
\ese
That is, $f$ is a non-negative, measurable, simple function and therefore
\bse
\int_{\N}\! f \,\d \mu := \sum_{n=0}^Nf(n)\mu(\{n\}) = \sum_{n=0}^Nf(n).
\ese
Hence, the ``integral'' of $f$ over $\N$ with respect to the counting measure is just the sum.
\ee

The need for simple functions to be in their standard form, which was introduced to avoid any potential ambiguity in the definition of their integral, can be relaxed using the following lemma.

\bl
\label{lem:simplelinear}
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $s$ and $t$ be non-negative, measurable, simple functions $M\to \R$ and let $c\in [0,\infty)$. Then
\bse
\int_M\!(cs+t)\,\d\mu = c\int_M\!s\,\d\mu+\int_M\!t\,\d\mu.
\ese
\el

\bp
\label{prp:MeasureIntegral}
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $s=\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \chi_{A_i}$ be a non-negative, measurable, simple function $M\to \R$ not necessarily in its standard form. Then
\bse
\int_M\!s\,\d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^nr_i\mu(A_i).
\ese
\ep

\bc
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $s$ and $t$ be non-negative, measurable, simple functions $M\to \R$ such that $s\leq t$ (that is, $s(m)\leq t(m)$ for all $m\in M$). Then
\bse
\int_M\!s\,\d\mu \leq \int_M\!t\,\d\mu. 
\ese
\ec

\bl
Let $(M,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a measure space and let $s = \sum_{i=1}^n{r_i\chi_{A_i}}$ be a non-negative, measurable, simple function $M\to\R$. Define the map

\nu_s \cl & \Sigma & \to & [0,\infty]\\
& A & \mapsto &  \int_M \! s\chi_A \, \d \mu,
\ei
where $s\chi_A$ is the pointwise product of $s$ and $\chi_A$. Then, $\nu_s$ is a measure on $(M,\Sigma)$.
\el

\bq
First, note that we have
\bse
\int_M \! s\chi_A \, \d \mu = \int_M \biggl(\sum_{\,i=1}^nr_i\chi_{A_i}\chi_{A}\biggr) \d \mu = \int_M \biggl(\sum_{\,i=1}^nr_i\chi_{A_i\cap A}\biggr) \d \mu  =\sum_{i=1}^nr_i\mu({A_i\cap A)}.
\ese
We now check that $\nu$ satisfies the defining properties of a measure.
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\displaystyle\nu_s(\varnothing):= \int_M \! s\chi_{\varnothing} \, \d \mu = \sum_{i=1}^n{r_i\mu({A_i\cap \varnothing})} = \sum_{i=1}^n{r_i\mu(\varnothing)} = 0$
\item Let $\{B_j\}_{j\in\N}$ be a pairwise disjoint sequence in $\Sigma$. Then
\bi{rCl}
\nu_s \biggl( \bigcup_{\,j=0}^{\infty}B_j \biggr) &=& \int_M \! s\chi_{ \left( \bigcup_{j=0}^{\infty}B_j \right)} \, \d \mu \\
& = & \sum_{i=1}^n r_i  \mu \biggl( \bigcup_{\,j=0}^{\infty}(A_i \cap B_j )\biggr)\\
&=& \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \mu (A_i \cap B_j )\\
&=& \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\int_M \! s\chi_{B_j} \, \d \mu \\
&=& \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\nu_s(B_j) .
\ei
\een
Thus, $\nu_s$ is a measure on $(M,\Sigma)$. \qedhere

\subsection{Integration of non-negative measurable functions}

As we are interested in measurable functions $M\to\overline{\R}$, we need to define a $\sigma$-algebra on $\overline{\R}$. We cannot use the Borel $\sigma$-algebra since we haven't even defined a topology on $\overline{\R}$. In fact, we can easily get a $\sigma$-algebra on $\overline{\R}$ as follows.

\bp
The set $\overline{\Sigma}:=\{A\in \mathscr{P}(\overline{\R})\mid A\cap \R \in \sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\overline{\R}$.
\ep
In other words, we can simply ignore the infinities in a subset of $\overline{\R}$ and consider it to be measurable if $A\setminus\{-\infty,+\infty\}$ is in the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $\R$. We will always consider $\overline{\R}$ to be equipped with this $\sigma$-algebra.

\bl
\label{lem:measurable}
Let $(M,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space and let $f,g\cl M\to \overline{\R}$ be measurable. Then, the following functions are measurable.
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item $cf+g$, for any $c\in \R$
\item $|f|$ and $f^2$
\item $fg$ (pointwise product) if $f$ and $g$ are nowhere infinite
\item $\max(f,g)$ (defined pointwise).

\bd
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $f\cl M\to\overline{\R}$ be a non-negative, measurable function. Denote by $S$ the set of all non-negative, measurable, simple functions $s\cl M \to \R$ such that $s\leq f$. Then, we define
\bse
\int_M\! f\, \d \mu := \sup_{s\in S} \int_M\! s\, \d \mu.

\br
It is often very convenient to introduce the notation
\bse
\int_M\!f(x)\,\mu(\d x) \equiv \int_M\! f\, \d \mu,
\ese
where $x$ is a dummy variable and could be replaced by any other symbol. The reason why this is a convenient notation is that, while some functions have standard symbols but cannot be easily represented by an algebraic expression (e.g. characteristic functions), others are easily expressed in terms of an algebraic formula but do not have a standard name. For instance, it is much easier to just write
\bse
\int_{\R}  x^2\,\mu(\d x)
\ese
than having to first denote the function $\R\to\R$, $x\mapsto x^2$ by a generic $f$ or, say, the more specific $\mathrm{sq}_{\R}$, and then write 
\bse
\int_\R\mathrm{sq}_{\R}\, \d \mu.

The following is the pivotal theorem of Lebesgue integration.

\bt[Monotone convergence theorem]
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$ be a sequence of non-negative, measurable functions $M\to\overline{\R}$ such that $f_{n+1}\geq f_n$ for all $n\in \N$. If there exists a function $f\cl M\to \overline{\R}$ such that
\bse
\forall \, m \in M : \ \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(m) = f(m)
\ese
(i.e. $f$ is the pointwise limit of  $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$), then $f$ is measurable and
\bse
\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_M\! f_n \, \d \mu = \int_M\! f \, \d \mu.
\ese
\et

\br
Observe that this result is in stark contrast with what one may be used from Riemann integration, where pointwise converge of a sequence of integrable functions $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is \emph{not} a sufficient condition for the integral of the limit $f$ to be equal to the limit of the integrals of $f_n$ or, in fact, even for $f$ to be integrable. For these, we need stronger conditions on the sequence $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$, such as uniform converge.
\er

The definition of the integral as a supremum is clear and geometrically reasonable. However, it is in general very difficult to evaluate
the integral of any particular function using it. The monotone convergence theorem provides a much simpler way to evaluate the integral. One can show that, for any non-negative, measurable function $f$, there exists an increasing sequence $\{s_n\}_{n\in\N}$ of non-negative, measurable, simple functions (which can be explicitly constructed from $f$) whose pointwise limit is $f$, and hence we have
\bse
\int_M\! f \, \d \mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_M\! s_n \, \d \mu,
\ese
where the right-hand side can usually be evaluated fairly easily.

\be
Consider the measure space $(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N),\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the counting measure, and let $f\cl \N \to \overline{\R}$ be non-negative. Note that the choice of $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{P}(\N)$ on $\N$ makes every function on $\N$ (to any measurable space) measurable. Define, for every $n\in \N$,  
\bse
s_n=\sum_{i=0}^nf(i)\chi_{\{i\}}.
\ese
Then, $\{s_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is an increasing sequence of non-negative, measurable, simple functions whose pointwise limit is $f$ and therefore, by the monotone convergence theorem,
\bse
\int_{\N}\! f \,\d \mu =\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{\N}\! s_n \, \d \mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=0}^nf(i)\mu(\{i\}) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}f(i).
\ese
If you ever wondered why series seem to share so many properties with integrals, the reason is that series are just integrals with respect to a discrete measure.
\ee

The monotone convergence theorem can be used to extend some of the properties of integrals of non-negative, measurable simple functions to non-negative, measurable functions which are not-necessarily simple.

Finally, we have a simple but crucial result for Lebesgue integration.

Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $f\cl M\to\overline{\R}$ be a non-negative, measurable function. Then

\item[$(\Rightarrow)$] Suppose that $\int_Mf\,\d\mu=0$. Define $A_n:=\{m\in M \mid f(m)>\tfrac{1}{n+1}\}$ and let
\bse
s_n := \tfrac{1}{n+1}\chi_{A_n} .
\ese
By definition of $A_n$, we clearly have $s_n\leq f$ for all $n\in\N$. Hence,
\bse
0\leq \int_M\!s_n\,\d\mu\leq\int_M\!f\,\d\mu=0

and thus, $\int_Ms_n\,\d\mu=0$ for all $n\in\N$. Since by definition
\bse
\int_M\!s_n\,\d\mu = \tfrac{1}{n+1}\mu(A_n),
\ese
we must also have $\mu(A_n)=0$ for all $n\in\N$. Let $A:=\{m\in M \mid f(m)\neq 0\}$. Then, as $f$ is non-negative, we have
\bse
A = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}A_n=\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}\{m\in M \mid f(m)>\tfrac{1}{n+1}\}
\ese

\bse
\mu(A)=\mu\biggl(\bigcup_{\,n=0}^{\infty}A_n\biggr)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(A_n) = 0.
\ese
Thus, $f$ is zero except on the null set $A$. That is, $f=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}0$. 

\item[$(\Leftarrow)$] Suppose that $f=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}0$. Let $S$ be the set of non-negative, measurable, simple functions $s$ such that $s\leq f$. As $f=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}0$, we have $s=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}0$ for all $s\in S$. Thus, if
\bse
s=\sum_{i=1}^nr_i\chi_{A_i},
\ese
we must have either $r_i=0$ or $\mu(A_i)=0$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$. Hence, for all $s\in S$,
\bse
\int_M\! s \, \d \mu := \sum_{i=1}^nr_i\mu(A_i) =0.

Therefore, we have

\int_M\! f \, \d \mu := \sup_{s\in S}\int_M\! s \, \d \mu  = 0.\qedhere

The Dirichlet function is the usual example of a function which is \emph{not} Riemann integrable (on any real interval). We will now show that we can easily assign a numerical value to its integral on any measurable subset of $\R$. First, note that a set $A\in\sigma(\mathcal{O}_{\R})$ is null with respect to the Lebesgue measure if, and only if, 
\bse
\forall \, \varepsilon >0 : \exists \, \{I_n\}_{n\in\N} : \quad A\subset \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}I_n \ \text{ and } \ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda(I_n)<\varepsilon
\ese
where $\{I_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is a sequence of real intervals. From this, it immediately follows that any countable subset of $\R$ has zero Lebesgue measure. Thus, $\lambda(\Q)=0$ and hence, $f=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}0$. Therefore, by the previous lemmas, we have
\bse
\int_A\! f \, \d \lambda = 0
\ese
for any measurable subset $A$ of $\R$.

\subsection{Lebesgue integrable functions}

Since the difference $\infty-\infty$ is not defined, we cannot integrate all measurable functions. There is, however, a very small extra condition (beyond measurability) that determines the class of functions to which we can extend our previous definition.

\bd
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $f\cl M\to\overline{\R}$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{(Lebesgue) integrable}\index{integrable function} if it is measurable and
\bse
\int_{M}\!|f|\,\d \mu < \infty.
\ese
We denote the set of all integrable functions $M\to\overline{\R}$ by $\mathscr{L}^1_{\R}(M,\Sigma,\mu)$, or simply $\mathscr{L}^1(M)$ if there is no risk of confusion.
\ed

For any $f\cl M\to \overline{\R}$, we define $f^+:=\max(f,0)$ and $f^-:=\max(-f,0)$, which are measurable whenever $f$ is measurable by part (iv) of \Cref{lem:measurable}.

It should be clear that the role of the integrability condition $\int_M |f|\, \d \mu<\infty$ is to prevent the integral of $f$ from being $\infty-\infty$, which is not defined.

In quantum mechanics, we usually deal with complex functions. The extension to the complex case of the integration theory presented thus far is straightforward.

\bd
Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space. A complex function $f\cl M\to\C$ is said to be \emph{integrable} if the real functions $\Re(f)$ and $\Im(f)$ are measurable and

\ese
where $|f|$ denotes the complex modulus, i.e.\ $|f|^2=\Re(f)^2+\Im(f)^2$. We denote the set of all integrable complex functions by $\mathscr{L}^1_{\C}(M,\Sigma,\mu)$, or simply $\mathscr{L}^1(M)$ if there is no risk of confusion.

The following lemma gives the properties expected of sums and scalar multiples of integrals. Note, however, that before we show that, say, the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals, it is necessary to first show that the sum of two functions in $\mathscr{L}^1(M)$ is again in $\mathscr{L}^1(M)$.

All the $\mathscr{L}^p$ spaces become vector spaces once equipped with pointwise addition and multiplication. Let us show this is detail for $\mathscr{L}_{\C}^2$.

\ep
In other words, the notion of semi-norm is a generalisation of that of norm obtained by relaxing the definiteness condition. If the measure space $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ is such that the empty set is the only null set, then $\|\cdot\|_p$ is automatically definite and hence, a norm.

\be
Consider $(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N),\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the counting measure. Then, as $\mu(A)$ is the cardinality of $A$, the only null set is the empty set. Thus, recalling that functions on $\N$ are just sequences, the maps

However, in general measure spaces, we only have
\bse
\|f\|_p = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad f =_{\mathrm{a.e.}} 0,
\ese
as we have shown in \Cref{thm:aezero} for $\mathscr{L}^1$, and it is often very easy to produce an $f\neq 0$ such that $\|f\|_p=0$. The solution to this problem is to construct new spaces from the $\mathscr{L}^p$ in which functions that are almost everywhere equal are, in fact, the same function. In other words, we need to consider the quotient space of $\mathscr{L}^p$ by the equivalence relation ``being almost everywhere equal''.

\bd
Let $M$ be a set. An \emph{equivalence relation} on $M$ is a set $\sim\ \subseteq M\times M$ such that, writing $a\sim b$ for $(a,b)\in\ \sim$, we have

for all $a,b,c\in M$. If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $M$, we define the \emph{equivalence class} of $m\in M$ by $[m]:=\{a\in M \mid m\sim a\}$ and the \emph{quotient set} of $M$ by $\sim$ by

Let $f,g,h\in\mathscr{L}^p$. Clearly, $f\sim f$ and $f\sim g \Leftrightarrow g \sim f$. Now suppose that $f\sim g$ and $g\sim h$. Then, there exist null sets $A,B\in\Sigma$ such that $f=g$ on $M\setminus A$ and $g=h$ on $M\setminus B$. Recall that $\sigma$-algebras are closed under intersections and hence, $A\cap B\in\Sigma$. Obviously, we have $f=h$ on $M\setminus (A\cap B)$ and, since
\bse
\mu(A\cap B) \leq \mu (A\cup B) \leq \mu(A)+\mu(B) = 0,
\ese
the set $A\cap B$ is null. Thus, $f\sim h$.

Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $f\sim g \Leftrightarrow f=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}g $. We define

L^p := \mathscr{L}^p/{\sim} = \{[f]\mid f\in \mathscr{L}^p\}.

Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space. Then, the maps

Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $p,q\in[1,\infty]$ be such that $\tfrac{1}{p}+\tfrac{1}{q}=1$ (where $\tfrac{1}{\infty}:=0$). Then, for all measurable functions $f,g\cl M\to \C$, we have
\bse
\biggl|\int_M\!fg \, \d \mu \biggr| \leq \biggl(\int_M\!|f|^p \, \d \mu\biggr)^{\negmedspace \frac{1}{p}}\biggl(\int_M\!|g|^q \, \d \mu\biggr)^{\negmedspace \frac{1}{q}}.
\ese
\el

Hence, if $[f]\in L^p$ and $[g]\in L^q$, with  $\tfrac{1}{p}+\tfrac{1}{q}=1$ , then $[fg]\in L^1$ and
\bse
\|[fg]\|_1\leq\|[f]\|^p\|[g]\|^q.
\ese

The equality holds if and only if $|f|^p$ and $|g|^q$ are linearly \emph{dependent} on $L^1$. That is, there exists non-negative real numbers $\alpha,\beta\in\R$ such that 
\bse 
\alpha |f|^p =_{a.e.} \beta |g|^q
\ese 
Note it is clear that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ cannot both vanish. 

\bt
The spaces $L^p$ are Banach spaces for all $p\in[0,\infty]$.
\et

We have already remarked that the case $p=2$ is special in that $L^2$ is the only $L^p$ space which can be made into a Hilbert space.

Let $(M,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and define
\bi{rrCl}
\langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle_{L^2} \cl & L^2\times L^2 & \to & \C\\
& ([f],[g]) & \mapsto & \displaystyle \int_M\!\overline{f}g\, \d \mu.
\ei
Then, $\langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle_{L^2} $ is well-defined and it is a sesqui-linear inner product on $L^2$.
\ep

\bq
First note that if $[f]\in L^2$, then $[\overline{f}]\in L^2$ and hence, by H\"older inequality, $[\overline{f}g]\in L^1$. This ensures that $\bigl\langle [f]\big|[g]\bigr\rangle_{L^2}\in \C$ for all $[f],[g]\in L^2$.

To show well-definedeness, let $f'=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}f$ and $g'=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}g$. Then, $\overline{f'}g'=_{\mathrm{a.e.}}\overline{f}g$ and thus
\bse
\bigl\langle [f']\big|[g']\bigr\rangle_{L^2} :=  \int_M\!\overline{f'}g'\, \d \mu =  \int_M\!\overline{f}g\, \d \mu =: \bigl\langle [f]\big|[g]\bigr\rangle_{L^2} .
\ese

Now, let $[f],[g],[h]\in L^2$ and $z\in \C$. Then
\ben[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\displaystyle\overline{\bigl\langle [f]\big|[g]\bigr\rangle}_{L^2} = \overline{\int_M\!\overline{f}g\, \d \mu} = \int_M\!f\overline{g}\, \d \mu = \bigl\langle [g]\big|[f]\bigr\rangle_{L^2}$
\item We have
\bi{rCl}
\bigl\langle [f]\big|z[g]+[h]\bigr\rangle_{L^2} & = & \int_M\!\overline{f}(zg+h)\, \d \mu \\
& = & z\int_M\!\overline{f}g\, \d \mu+\int_M\!\overline{f}h\, \d \mu \\
& = & z\bigl\langle [f]\big|[g]\bigr\rangle_{L^2}+\bigl\langle [f]\big|[h]\bigr\rangle_{L^2}
\ei
\item We have $\displaystyle\bigl\langle [f]\big|[f]\bigr\rangle_{L^2} = \int_M\!\overline{f}f\, \d \mu = \int_M\!|f|^2\, \d \mu \geq 0 $ and
\bse
\bigl\langle [f]\big|[f]\bigr\rangle_{L^2} = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \int_M\!|f|^2\, \d \mu = 0  \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \|[f]\|_2 = 0.
\ese
Thus, $[f]=0:=[0]$. \qedhere

The last part of the proof also shows that $\langle\cdot | \cdot \rangle_{L^2}$ induces the norm $\|\cdot\|_2$, with respect to which $L^2$ is a Banach space. Hence, $(L^2,\langle\cdot | \cdot \rangle_{L^2})$ is a Hilbert space.

\br
The inner product $\langle\cdot | \cdot \rangle_{L^2}$ on $L^2_{\C}(\N,\mathscr{P}(\N),\mu)$ coincides with the inner product $\langle\cdot | \cdot \rangle_{\ell^2}$ on $\ell^2(\N)$ defined in the section on separable Hilbert spaces.
